===========
omnimetrics
===========

The goal is to gather metrics from OmniFocus so I can get a sense of

 - how heavy my workload is
 - whether I am making progress

But in reality this is a bunch of scripts to do stuff with OmniFocus.

Assumptions
===========

- OmniFocus 3

Brainstorm
==========

What questions do I want answered?

 - I want some kind of warning when I've taken too much on

   - this probably means too many actions?

 - I want to know whether I've had a productive day / week or not

   - productive == lots of things completed
   - winning == more things completed than added
   - unproductive == lots of things added

 - I want some kind of split between "Work" and "Personal" domains
